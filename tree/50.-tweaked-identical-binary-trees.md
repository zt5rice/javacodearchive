# 50. Tweaked Identical Binary Trees

Medium

Determine whether two given binary trees are identical assuming any number of ‘tweak’s are allowed. A tweak is defined as a swap of the children of one node in the tree.

**Examples**

        5

      /    \

    3        8

  /   \

1      4

and

        5

      /    \

    8        3

           /   \

          1     4

the two binary trees are tweaked identical.

**How is the binary tree represented?**

We use the level order traversal sequence with a special symbol "\#" denoting the null node.

**For Example:**

The sequence \[1, 2, 3, \#, \#, 4\] represents the following binary tree:

    1

  /   \

 2     3

      /

    4

/**
 * public class TreeNode {
 *   public int key;
 *   public TreeNode left;
 *   public TreeNode right;
 *   public TreeNode(int key) {
 *     this.key = key;
 *   }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
  public boolean isTweakedIdentical(TreeNode one, TreeNode two) {
    // Write your solution here
    if (one == null && two == null) {
      return true;
    } else if (one == null || two == null) {
      return false;
    } else if (one.key != two.key) {
      return false;
    }
    return isTweakedIdentical(one.left, two.left) && isTweakedIdentical(one.right, two.right)||
     isTweakedIdentical(one.left, two.right) && isTweakedIdentical(one.right, two.left);
  }
} // time: o(n^2), space(o(height))

```
